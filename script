“<First Slide> <actually slide# 2>
Hello everyone! A very good <morning/afternoon>! Myself Yurekan and my colleague & friend Dhanush from the GET batch of 2024!
We are here to present to you our idea of First Challenge Program - "Hyper-Personalization in Sony E-Commerce".

Firstly, we have a question to you. How many of you spend more than 30 mins a day on your smartphone apart from phone calls ofcourse?
<atleast 4/5 will say yes>
& Why do you use it? The simple answer would be because you get an individualized smartphone experience, be it using Netflix where
you see movies or buy stuff on Amazon etc. etc. - correct? Yes, according to research by customer engagement platform Twilio, 62% 
of consumers say they expect personalization, and a brand will lose their loyalty without it. 
An additional 49% of consumers say they will become repeat buyers/users if personalization is offered! That's the power of Personalization!

<Second Slide>
And that is exactly why we are here today, to showcase how & why Hyper-Personalization & by hyper-personalization we mean that every customer
gets a tailored, dynamic shopping experience that aligns with his/her own preferences - can be used to maximize Sony's revenue in 
Direct To Consumer (D2C) space in this era where everything is going digital!

<Demo>
We wanted you to Experience our idea yourselves rather than we giving a demo of it to you. So, lets do a small exercise!
How many of you like TVs over Cameras? How many of you like Cameras over TVs? <lets say 2 of them raise their hands>
<Hand them over the appropriate credentials & ask them to login>

Now, please login to the URL with the credentials - <give the URL> & tell us what you see! <with a smile on your face>
<they will tell about TV & Camera separately>
Now, this is exactly what hyper-personalization means. It is the same URL that both of you have entered but the look & feel is completely
different, highly personalized to your interests & preferences!

<make them experience all possible use cases of the demo> --- engage them for 5 mins here

<Third Slide>
Now, imagine that you have such a level of personalization being data driven wherein, the customer's behavioural data is being collected,
passed through a recommendation engine for real-time product & bundle suggestions, and dynamic content delivery that you have just seen!
This is our approach towards how hyper-personalization can be included in Sony's eCommerce business!
We have had a brief of our idea shared with the SEU business stakeholder as well, and he has confirmed that any level of personalization
that can be brought into D2C should be considered, as we dont have any at the moment! We'll be having a demo of our idea with SEU business
in February as well!

<Fourth slide>
Where we envisage Sony to reach is somewhere from Behavioural recommendations to Predictive personalization over the next few years, given 
the nature of D2C that Sony is into. Personalization is no longer going to be a luxury, it is going to be a necessity!

The tech stack used for the POC & their highlights have also been mentioned along with the Architecture or the Design of our solution
from both the end user standpoint (which is how you experienced it) and the administrator standpoint which is where the business teams will 
eventually get involved in reviewing & offering the bundles.
I wouldnt want to delve deep into these, however open for any questions on these slides.

<Seventh Slide>
The obvious benefits are product recommendations getting personalized, dynamic bundling, cross selling opportunities given that Sony's long
term vision is to have One single Commerce platform across all LOBs, improved user conversion rates & increased user engagement & higher
click through rate. One of the questions that were posed during our first presentation was around ROI wherein we went back, researched &
have put our thoughts.
The revenue that Sony earns across D2C platforms annually - $ 40 – 45 billion - involves Electronics & PlayStation
Even if we assume a bare minimum of 5% increase due to personalization, the expected turnover is ~ $47-48 billion annually

We have also thought of customer lifetime value which is a product of no.of purchases that a customer makes annually, the profitability of
the purchase and the length of commercial relationship that the customer will have with Sony. So, assuming a purchase of 2 products per
customer annually, and the profitability being ~1000, the CLV for the duration of 5 yrs would be ~10000 which is huge!!!

<Eighth slide>
Moving on to the hurdles along the journey in the last 3 months and how we were able to overcome them, 
<speak about all the 5 of them in brief>

<Ninth slide>
A few of our major learnings through the entire FCP program. 
The top most in the list is the networking & collaboration. We go to speak to a lot of people, got insights & feedback to make our idea
stand where it is today. Of course, we got to explore new technogies that we had absolutely zero knowledge on before working on FCP, tried
out different solutions to achieving the 4 ideas of our POC <mention about them - dynamic bundling, personalization etc.>, and most
importantly, we have developed confidence in our presentation & communication skills.

That's all from us. A big thanks to Sony, the FCP committee for organizing a transition program like this from our college days to our 
professional career and Revathy ma'am for mentoring us thru the journey. Thank you!”
